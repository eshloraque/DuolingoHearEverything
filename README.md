# DuolingoHearEverything

If you're using Duolingo for learning, you might discover, that Duolingo does not speak a lot of sentences. If you're better in learning by listening (especially if the language sounds different to the written language like french) you probably want to hear more spoken words. That's exactly, what this script does. It tries to speak as many sentences as possible.
